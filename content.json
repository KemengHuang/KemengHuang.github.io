{"pages":[],"posts":[{"title":"ABOUT ME","text":"I am a second-year PhD student in the Computer Science at The University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Taku Komura. I graduated with honors from Zhejiang University of Technology (Jianxing class) in July 2017, where I received my B.Eng. in Software Engineering. During my internship at the State Key Lab of CAD&amp;CG, Zhejiang University (2015-2017), I worked on computer graphics under the supervision of Associate Professor Zhangye Wang (ZJU). My undergraduate thesis focused on the design and development of a real-time infrared simulation system for natural environments. In July 2020, I graduated with honors from East China Normal University, earning my M.Phil. in Software Engineering. There, I worked on computer graphics and high performance computing under the supervision of Professor Changbo Wang (ECNU) and Professor Hong Qin (Stony Brook University, New York). My master’s thesis was on a hybrid parallel framework for SPH algorithms. I am currently working with Dr. Minchen Li at Carnegie Mellon University, focusing on Numerical Optimization, differentiable simulation and Robotics. My current research interests include: Physical simulation, High performance computing, Sim2Real(Robotics), Sim4ML, Machine Learning, Geometry processing, Rendering. I hope our research can help advance the development of real-time, physically accurate virtual world, and assist artificial intelligence in gaining a more efficient and comprehensive understanding of the real physical world.
