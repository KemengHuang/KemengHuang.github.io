{"pages":[],"posts":[{"title":"ABOUT ME","text":"I am a second-year PhD student in the Computer Science at The University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Taku Komura. Before starting my Ph.D study journey, I worked with Prof. Hong Qin (Stony Brook University, New York) and Prof. Changbo Wang (ECNU) on Physical Simulation and High-Performance Computing, specifically focusing on real-time fluid simulation. I am currently working with Dr. Minchen Li at Carnegie Mellon University, focusing on Numerical Optimization, differentiable simulation and Robotics. My current research interests include: Physical simulation, High performance computing, Differentiable simulation, Sim2Real(Robotics), Sim4ML, Machine Learning, Geometry processing, Rendering. I hope our research can help advance the development of real-time, physically accurate virtual world, and assist artificial intelligence in gaining a more efficient and comprehensive understanding of the real physical world. Hope that one day you will love my virtual physical world :—) NEWS2024 - One another interesting and super useful work is on the horizon.2024 - We have opensourced the first fully GPU optimized IPC framework without sacrificing accuracy.2024 - We have opensourced a highly optimized GPU MPM framework with clean code organization. Hope it can be helpful for high performance simulation learners.2023 - We have opensourced a highly optimized GPU SPH framework. While the code organization may not be perfect, the underlying parallel concept is clear and robust. Hope it can be helpful for high performance simulation learners.
