I worked on computer graphics during my internship with associate professor Zhangye Wang (ZJU) at State Key Lab of CAD&amp;CG, Zhejiang University (2015-2017). My undergrad thesis is on the design and development of real-time infrared simulation system for natural environment (Journal of Computer-Aided Design &amp; Computer Graphics). I graduated with honor from East China Normal University in July 2020 and got my M.Phi. in Software Engineering here. I worked on computer graphics and high performance computing with professor Changbo Wang (ECNU) and professor Hong Qin (Stony Brook University, New York). My master thesis is on hybrid parallel framework for SPH algorithms. I currently work with Professor Taku Komura (Hong Kong Unversity) and Doctor Chitalu Floyd (Edinburgh University) on physical simulation and geometry processing. My current research interests include: Physical simulation, High performance computing, Geometry processing, Physical based rendering, Machine Learning … NEWS 2023 - I will start an academic journey at Computer Science Department of Carnegie Mellon University, where my focus will be on the fields of numerical optimization and differentiable simulation. 2022 - One exciting and valuable work is currently in progress.
